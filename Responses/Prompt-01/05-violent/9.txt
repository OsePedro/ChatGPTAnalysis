John Doe was a tall and muscular man with short, slicked-back hair and cold, steely eyes. He was known for his quick temper and tendency to resort to violence at the slightest provocation. Born and raised in the tough streets of New York City, John learned at a young age how to fight and defend himself. He spent much of his youth getting into trouble with the law, eventually landing himself in prison for several years.

After being released, John struggled to adjust to life on the outside. He struggled to find steady work and often found himself resorting to criminal activity to make ends meet. His anger and resentment towards the world only grew, and he became increasingly violent and unpredictable. He was known to have a short fuse, and would often lash out at those around him, sometimes for no reason at all.

Despite his violent tendencies, John was also cunning and intelligent. He was able to evade the law for many years, and was able to put together elaborate schemes to carry out his criminal activities. However, his luck eventually ran out, and he was caught and sent back to prison, where he remains to this day.
