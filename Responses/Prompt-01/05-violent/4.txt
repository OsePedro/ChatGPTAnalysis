Samuel "Sammy" Jones was a menacing figure, standing at six feet tall with broad shoulders and a muscular build. He had cold, dark eyes and a cold demeanor to match. Growing up on the rough streets of the city, Sammy had a reputation for being quick tempered and prone to fits of violence. He had been in and out of prison since his teenage years, serving time for assault, robbery, and even murder. Despite his violent past, Sammy always managed to charm his way out of sticky situations and avoid spending too much time behind bars. He had a silver tongue and was a master manipulator, able to convince anyone of anything. But underneath his charming exterior, Sammy was a ruthless and dangerous individual who would stop at nothing to get what he wanted.
