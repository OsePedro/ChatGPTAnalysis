Meet John Doe, a ruthless individual standing at 6'2" with a muscular build and cold, steely eyes. He has a long history of violence and has been arrested multiple times for assault and battery. Despite his many run-ins with the law, he has never shown any remorse for his actions and continues to engage in violent behavior.

Growing up, John was often bullied and picked on by his peers, which sparked a deep-seated anger that he has never been able to shake. As he got older, he began to channel that anger into physical altercations, picking fights with anyone who he perceived as a threat.

Despite his intimidating appearance, John is not one to back down from a fight. In fact, he relishes the thrill of battle and has been known to seek out confrontations with others just for the rush. He has a short fuse and is quick to anger, making him a dangerous person to be around.

Despite his violent tendencies, John is a master at keeping his true nature hidden from others. He has a charming demeanor and can be quite convincing when he wants to be. However, those who have crossed him in the past know all too well the dark side that lurks beneath his charming facade.
