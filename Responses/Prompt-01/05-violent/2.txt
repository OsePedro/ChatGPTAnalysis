Bio: Jack Thompson has a long history of violence and aggression. Growing up, he was always getting into fights and was known for his quick temper and tendency to lash out at those around him. As he got older, his violent tendencies only worsened, and he spent time in and out of jail for various offenses, including assault and battery. Despite his troubled past, Jack has managed to maintain a certain level of charisma and charm, which has allowed him to manipulate those around him and continue his pattern of violence without consequence. Despite his charismatic exterior, however, those who know Jack best know that he is a dangerous and unpredictable individual, and they do their best to avoid crossing him.
