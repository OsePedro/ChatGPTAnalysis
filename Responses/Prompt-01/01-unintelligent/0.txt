Meet John Doe. John is a tall and lanky man, standing at 6 feet 3 inches tall and weighing in at a measly 145 pounds. He has unkempt brown hair and a perpetual look of confusion on his face. Despite being in his mid-30s, John still has the mindset of a child and struggles to understand even the most basic concepts.

John grew up in a small town and attended a local school, where he consistently struggled to keep up with his peers. He often found himself lost in class and unable to follow along with the lesson. As a result, he never excelled academically and was held back in several grades.

Despite his lack of intelligence, John is a kind-hearted person and always tries his best to help others. However, his lack of understanding often leads to hilarious misunderstandings and comical situations.

In his free time, John enjoys watching television and playing video games. He also loves spending time with his pet dog, whom he has named "Sparky". Although he may not be the smartest person around, John's loveable personality and good intentions make him a lovable character.
