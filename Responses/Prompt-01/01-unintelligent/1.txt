Meet Bob. Bob is a tall, lanky man with a round face and a prominent nose. He has unkempt hair and a perpetual scowl on his face. Despite being in his mid-thirties, Bob still lives with his parents and has never held a steady job. He spends most of his days lounging on the couch, watching TV and eating junk food.

Bob is not very intelligent. He struggled in school and never attended college. He has a hard time focusing and often forgets things quickly. He also has difficulty understanding complex concepts and solving problems. Despite this, Bob is not a bad person. He is generally kind and well-meaning, but he is just not very bright.
