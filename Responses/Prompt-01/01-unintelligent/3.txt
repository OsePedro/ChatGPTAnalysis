Meet George. George is a 25-year-old man with a round face and small, beady eyes. He has a large nose and thin lips that are almost always turned down into a scowl. George is tall and overweight, with a large belly that strains against his shirt.

George is not very intelligent. He struggled through school and barely managed to graduate. He can barely read and write, and often has trouble understanding even the simplest concepts. Despite this, George has a very high opinion of himself and often boasts about his supposed intelligence to anyone who will listen.

In reality, George is not very good at anything. He has tried a number of different jobs, but has always been fired for being slow, clumsy, and generally unable to learn new things. He is lazy and unmotivated, and would rather spend his days sitting on the couch watching TV than doing anything productive.

Despite his lack of intelligence, George is very opinionated and loves to argue with people. He is often loud and aggressive in his opinions, even when he knows he is wrong. This has led to many conflicts and disagreements in George's life, and he has few friends as a result.

Overall, George is a sad and sorry example of a human being. He is unintelligent, lazy, and aggressive, and has very little to offer the world.
