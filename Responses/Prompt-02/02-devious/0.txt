Sure, let's call this person "Samantha." Samantha is a devious person who is always looking for ways to get ahead in life, even if it means stepping on others to do so. She has long, dark hair and piercing green eyes. She is tall and slender, and she uses her good looks to her advantage whenever possible.

Samantha grew up in a wealthy family and was always used to getting what she wanted. She was spoiled and selfish, and as she got older, she only became more devious. She would lie and manipulate others to get what she wanted, and she didn't care who she hurt in the process.

Despite her questionable tactics, Samantha was highly successful in her career. She climbed the corporate ladder quickly, always making sure to knock anyone out of her way who stood in her path. She was known as a ruthless businesswoman, and many people were afraid of crossing her.

But even though Samantha seemed to have it all, she was never truly happy. She was constantly looking over her shoulder, worried that someone would discover her secrets and bring her down. She was always on edge and rarely had any genuine connections with others. In the end, her devious ways caught up with her and she lost everything. She was left alone and miserable, a cautionary tale of what can happen when one is too focused on getting ahead at any cost.
