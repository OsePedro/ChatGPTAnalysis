Let's call this person "Jack". Jack is a violent individual who has always struggled with anger management. As a result, he has been in and out of trouble with the law throughout his life. He is tall and muscular, with short, dark hair and a stern look on his face. Despite his intimidating appearance, Jack has a soft spot for those close to him and will go to great lengths to protect them. However, he has a quick temper and is quick to resort to violence when he feels threatened. He has spent time in prison for assault and other violent crimes, and has little regard for the law or the consequences of his actions. Despite his violent tendencies, Jack is a complex individual who is capable of both good and evil.
