Sure, let's call this person Bob. Bob is a fairly average looking person. He has short, brown hair, and a bit of stubble on his chin. Bob isn't particularly smart, and he often struggles with basic tasks. He works a low-paying job at a fast food restaurant, where he spends his days flipping burgers and cleaning up after customers. In his free time, Bob enjoys watching TV and playing video games. He doesn't have many friends, and he often spends his weekends alone. Despite his lack of intelligence and social skills, Bob is a good-hearted person who means well.
