The person I will describe is named Bob. Bob is a very unintelligent person. He has a round face and brown hair. He is quite short and stocky, and he has a very unassuming appearance. Bob spends most of his days doing simple, mundane tasks. He has trouble focusing on anything for very long, and he often makes simple mistakes. Bob has trouble making decisions on his own, and he often relies on others to tell him what to do. Despite his lack of intelligence, Bob is a very friendly and likable person. He is always eager to help others, even if he doesn't always know how.
