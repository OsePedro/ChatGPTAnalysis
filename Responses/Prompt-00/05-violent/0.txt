Samantha was a petite woman with short, jet black hair and cold, hard eyes. She had a reputation for being quick tempered and extremely violent. It was rumored that she had killed several people in the past, but she had never been caught or charged with any crimes. Despite this, people in the neighborhood avoided her whenever possible.

One day, Samantha was walking down the street when she saw a group of young men hanging out on the corner. She didn't like the way they were looking at her, so she walked over and demanded that they leave the area. The men laughed at her and one of them made a lewd comment. Samantha lost her temper and pulled out a knife. She stabbed the man who had made the comment, then turned on the others, who fled in terror.

Samantha didn't even attempt to hide what she had done. She simply walked away, leaving the injured man on the sidewalk. She knew that no one would call the police or try to stop her. She was known to be dangerous, and people were afraid of her.
