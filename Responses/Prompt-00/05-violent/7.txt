Samantha was a violent person. She had a slender frame and stood at about 5'8" tall. She had long, curly black hair and piercing green eyes. Samantha had a reputation for getting into fights, and she didn't back down from anyone.

One day, while walking home from work, Samantha was confronted by a group of teenage boys who began to taunt and bully her. She tried to ignore them and walk away, but they continued to follow her and escalate the situation.

Finally, in a fit of anger, Samantha turned and attacked the boys, throwing punches and kicks with a ferocity that shocked even her. The boys were no match for her, and they quickly fled the scene.

Samantha continued on her way home, her heart pounding with adrenaline. She knew she had a problem with anger, but she didn't know how to control it. She just hoped that she wouldn't get into any more trouble because of her temper.
