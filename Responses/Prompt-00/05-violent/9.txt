Once upon a time, there was a man named John who was known to be very violent. He was tall and muscular, with piercing green eyes and a buzzcut. He had a large tattoo of a skull on his right arm, and he always carried a knife with him. John had grown up in a rough part of the city, and he had been involved in many fights from a young age. As he got older, his violence only increased, and he became known as one of the most feared people in the neighborhood. Despite his reputation, he always seemed to be able to avoid getting caught by the police. One day, however, he finally went too far and ended up in prison.
