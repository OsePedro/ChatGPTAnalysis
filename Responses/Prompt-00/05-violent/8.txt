Anna was a short, stocky woman with dark hair and cold, hard eyes. She had a reputation for being quick to anger and slow to forgive, and she had a long history of violent outbursts. She had been in and out of jail for most of her adult life, and she had a long rap sheet that included charges for assault, battery, and even attempted murder.

Despite her violent past, Anna had managed to stay out of trouble for the past few years. She had been working at a small convenience store in a quiet town, and she seemed to have turned over a new leaf. But one day, something snapped, and Anna's violent tendencies resurfaced.

It started with a minor disagreement with one of her coworkers over a mistake with one of the store's orders. Anna began yelling and cursing, and before anyone knew what was happening, she had grabbed a knife from behind the counter and lunged at her coworker. Fortunately, the other woman was able to get away, but Anna was quickly arrested and taken into custody.

As she sat in her jail cell, Anna couldn't help but think about what had led her down this path. She knew that she had a problem with anger, but she had never been able to get the help she needed to deal with it. She vowed to herself that she would get the help she needed, and that she would never let her anger get the better of her again.
