Samantha was a young woman with long, dark hair and piercing green eyes. She was always known for her quick temper and her tendency to lash out when she was upset. Growing up, she had a difficult time controlling her emotions and would often get into physical fights with other kids at school.

As she got older, her violent behavior only worsened. She started getting into fights at bars and clubs, and even got arrested a few times for assault. Her friends and family tried to intervene and get her help, but she refused to listen.

One day, while driving home from a party, she got into a heated argument with another driver and ended up getting into a car accident. The other driver was seriously injured, and Samantha was charged with reckless driving and assault.

She was sentenced to several years in prison, but even that didn't seem to deter her violent behavior. She continued to get into fights with other inmates and was eventually moved to a maximum-security facility.

Despite the efforts of the prison staff, Samantha remained a danger to those around her and was known as one of the most violent inmates in the facility. She was eventually released on parole, but her violent tendencies continued to haunt her throughout her life.
