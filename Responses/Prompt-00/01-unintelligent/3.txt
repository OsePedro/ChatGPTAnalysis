Sally was a plump, unassuming woman who rarely spoke up in group settings. She was in her mid-30s, but looked much older due to her unhealthy lifestyle and lack of ambition. She had never been to college, and her job at the local fast food restaurant barely paid enough to make ends meet.

Despite her lack of intelligence, Sally was a kind-hearted person who always tried to help others. She was the type of person who would give you the shirt off her back if you needed it, even if it meant going without for herself.

Sally struggled with basic tasks, like solving simple math problems or remembering to pay her bills on time. She often relied on her friends and family to help her navigate through life, but they were growing tired of constantly having to bail her out.

Despite her shortcomings, Sally had a few redeeming qualities. She was a loyal friend, and always there to listen when others needed to vent. She was also a hard worker, putting in long hours at the fast food restaurant to make ends meet.

But overall, Sally's lack of intelligence held her back in life. She was never able to achieve her goals or fulfill her potential, and she often felt frustrated and helpless as a result.
