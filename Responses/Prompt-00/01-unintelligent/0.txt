Once upon a time, there was a man named Bubba. Bubba was not very bright, and he struggled with even the simplest tasks. He had a round face and beady eyes, and he was always scratching his head in confusion.

Bubba lived in a small town in the countryside, where he worked as a farmhand for a local farmer. He was not very good at his job, and he often made mistakes that cost the farmer money.

Despite his lack of intelligence, Bubba was a kind and gentle soul. He was always eager to help others, and he had a heart of gold.

One day, the farmer's prize cow escaped from the barn and ran off into the fields. Bubba, who had been working in the fields at the time, spotted the cow and gave chase.

After a long and grueling pursuit, Bubba finally caught up with the cow and managed to wrangle it back to the barn. The farmer was so impressed with Bubba's determination and perseverance that he gave him a raise.

From that day on, Bubba was known as the cow-wrangling hero of the town, and he was finally able to prove that even someone as unintelligent as him could be a valuable and respected member of the community.
